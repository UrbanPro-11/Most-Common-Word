Hello.

To use this, copy all of the files onto your code editor. (VS Code, PyCharm, repl, etc.)
You can rename the files but make sure to rename them in main.py as well. Adjust whatever you like.

This is a beginner/intermediate project. Please add on whatever you would like! I might be adding other functions/files into this.

Thanks for stopping by, and enjoy using the project!
